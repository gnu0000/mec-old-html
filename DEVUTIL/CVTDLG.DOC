     If the input file has an extension of DLG, it's output file will have the
   extension of OS2. Otherwise, the output file will have the extension of DLG.
     The file format of 'FName' for the -class and -style options is the same
   as that produced by the -xlate option. blank lines and lines starting with a
   semicolon ';' are ignored.  New entrys take precedence over old ones.
