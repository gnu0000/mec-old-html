        objfile .... If specified, is the name of the object file.
                     If not given, the input file + '.obj' is used.

        [options1] are 0 or more of:
           /? ................ This help.
           /HelpDat .......... Help with the datfile format.
           /Header[=hname] ... Create Header file, hname is optional.
           /Sizes ............ Create variable size #defines in header.
           /Verbose .......... Display info during compile.
           /Alignment=# ...... Align Data on 1,2,4 or 16 byte boundries.
           /StartSeg=# ....... 1st created segment will have this index.
           /Debug ............ Debug stuff, currently does nothing.

        [options2] are the same as [options1] plus:
           /Variable=varname . Variable Name (Default is Var).
           /SegName=segname .. Segment Name  (Default is a new seg).
           /Type=typename .... Data Type (Default is CHAR).

Usage #1 uses a DAT file to gather information and data for variables.  A DAT
file is structured like a INI file.  Standard C character conversions of the
form \n and \x1A are performed on the text in this file.  Type
'Data2Obj /HelpDat' for the format of the dat file.

Usage #2 uses an entire file as the contents of a variable.  Variable
information must be specified on the command line.  No character conversions
are performed on the variable data.
